Webots Driverless Simulation Competition
The system design and code for a driverless vehicle needs to be validated before being tested on a driverless car in a physical environment. Unfortunately, before the code can be tested physically, we must undergo the expensive process of organising a suitable location/event, ensure the electrical and mechanical systems of the vehicle are operational, and accept the risk of errors causing damage to the car.
On the other hand, simulation software provides a virtual environment in which to experiment with various methods of autonomous navigation cheaply, easily, and safely.
A standard vehicle in the Webots robotics simulator will be given. This vehicle contains a basic kinematic tyre/axle model with a set of motors, as well as the following sensors:
•	Distance Sensors
•	Lidar
•	Camera
•	Gyroscope
•	Accelerometer
Use a sample environment with a racetrack or build your own.
You are to program this autonomous vehicle to navigate for at least one full lap around a track. Use any of the supported languages to write the robot controller. Use any combination of sensors to accomplish this, as well as computer vision implementations.
Once functional, the goal is to optimise the navigation algorithm to achieve the fastest lap times possible, avoiding collisions, for multiple laps around each track.
